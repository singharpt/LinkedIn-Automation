  <h1>Automated LinkedIn Data Sharing Tool</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn users often create posts to share data publicly, requesting interested users to comment with their email addresses. These posts can receive an overwhelming response, sometimes exceeding 1000+ interested users. To address this challenge, I have developed an in-house solution that automates the process of sending requested data to interested users.</p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Privacy-Focused:</strong> Unlike other online solutions, my tool doesn't require you to share your personal data with a website, ensuring your privacy.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost-Free:</strong> My solution is completely free to use, saving you money while simplifying the data sharing process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Additional Benefits:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Automatic Cron Scheduling:</strong> Schedule data sharing at your convenience.</li>
    <li><strong>Cache Management:</strong> Prevent duplicate emails from being sent to the same user, enhancing efficiency.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Create a Post:</strong> Share your data on LinkedIn and ask interested users to comment with their email addresses.</li>
    <li><strong>Automated Data Sharing:</strong> The solution automatically collects email addresses from comments and sends the requested data to each user.</li>
    <li><strong>Scheduled Delivery:</strong> Using the built-in cron scheduling feature you can send data at specific times.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficient Cache Management:</strong> The tool ensures that duplicate emails are not sent to the same user.</li>
  </ol>
